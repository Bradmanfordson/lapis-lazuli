## Intent of REAL Adversaries:
1. Stealth
2. Theft
3. Distruction

- Typically the more popular a tool is, the more likely it's used by a red teamer.
- Use weirdo old stuff and who knows?

## How to be less like a "red teamer" and more like a "REAL Adversary":
			     ____________
			     | Accuracy |
			     ------------
               /              \
              /                \
             /                  \
	_________                    ________                
    | Speed | ------------------ | Cost |
    ---------                    --------
	               Pick two!    
- Align on your goals
	- this is where duration comes in handy.... 
- Team Alignment
	- Should you alert on the command `date` running? Prolly not, who really cares?
- BUILD on testng libraries and frameworks
