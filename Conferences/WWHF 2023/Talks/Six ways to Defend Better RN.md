Objective: Create a landmine-centric security program.

1. Continual Telemetry improvements and visibility
2. customized detection to organization based on threat models
3. agile workflow process for detection engineering
4. hunt for unusual behavior based on The Long Tail by Chris Anderson
5. incorporate deception - low cost, high value
6. quick hit TTPs that are flexible.

Landmines:
- in AD - separate technical and non-technical classes of groups. If non-technical do ANYTHING technical, then trigger an alarm!
- if regular user - and match LOLBIN - raise an alarm...
- Deception - add honey pot deceptions in NON-honey pots
## DECEPTION IS THE WAY
- every time deceptions is put in place, the pentesters get caught.


The industry tells us to do XYZ, fuck that noise, do what makes sense, do what works. Learn HOW the attackers are getting caught and implement that shit.
