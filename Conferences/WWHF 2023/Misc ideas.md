- can i do cloudtrail bypasses to avoid SCARE?
- use graphrunner to search and enumerate sharepoint. 
- go-graphrunner - see if i can practice golang AND azure by rewriting it in go
- Send resume to Mike @ Red Siege
- "exe" that builds a docker image that has read access to the system, so I can look through the system and do shit, but as docker as my proxy?
- on the defense side - can we write something that forces all programs to execute under firecracker vm? something lightweight that is secure and doesnt have access to the host file system (unless it explicitly needs XYZ file.)
- data exfil by spinning up a container, loading the info to the container, the container has a direct connection to an external network (how i can play jackbox games in at work)
- reverse engineer the `stat` command, it's used my mv and prolly other things, might be fun.
