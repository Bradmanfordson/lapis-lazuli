## 1. What are the reasons for making a distinction between the Law of Nature and “herd instinct”, ¶s 2, 3 and 4?

## 2. Some things we learn in school are merely good manners and social convention. Other things we learn, like mathematics, are universal truths, ¶ 6. Why is there good reason to believe that the Law of Human Nature is a universal truth, ¶7? 
1. I don't know how i feel about this still. Natural mathematics is proven correct/true through logical evaluation and proof and lack of any means of contradiction. There are no circumstances where natural mathematical law has contradictions. Tho, there seem to be humans born with chemical imbalances and such which renders an exception, or contradiction. As rare as this is.... i need to think about this more
## 3. How would you answer someone who has reservations about a universal morality?
Saaaame....
