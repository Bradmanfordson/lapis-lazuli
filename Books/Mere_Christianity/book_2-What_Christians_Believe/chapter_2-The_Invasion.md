## 1. Lewis concludes that both atheism and Christian Liberalism (Lewis calls it “Christianity-and-water”) aren’t sufficient. What specifically is Lewis’s objection to Christian Liberalism, ¶s 3, 4 and 5?

Many attacks and beliefs of atheism are weak at best. They don't want to have to think harder than what's necessary to eat, sleep and mate. They are the "animals" of the human race. They don't want to be challenged, they don't want to think, they want to live a life and not worry about anything. Which is ironic because that's not a life worth living. Life without challenge isn't life at all.

This universe we live in is infinitely complex. So is theology and philosophy. Especially when we get into the only religion that truly makes sense at its core, Pure Christianity. There is an overwhelming amount of evidence for the most complex story in existence. This isn't just a story either, it's reality. Reality of men being thrown into a flaming furnace and living, reality of a man predicting the exact events of the coming of a man 3,000 years before he was born, the reality of a man dying and extremely gruesome death - one that involved torture so severe most humans couldn't even survive that - and that man coming to life mere days later.

This is not easy to accept, this does not flow in the static universe that simple folks want to believe in. Mathematical analysis has shown that our planet earth is actually about a "day behind" where it *should be* according to science (actual NASA study...).

How is that simple? How is that easy to digest? It's difficult and we cant survive off of mere milk. Milk sustains babies while they grow, but eventually they need substance.


## 2. According to Lewis, there are only two religious systems which directly confront the problem of evil and a good God, Dualism and Christianity (¶ 6). What does Dualism teach and what is its fatal flaw, ¶s 7, 8 and 9? 

Dualism teaches that there are two entities fighting out their beliefs and earth is the battle ground.

What is truly right and what is truly wrong? How do we know? it ends up being a preference. If it's a pure preference then we'd take what enables us to achieve the fastest regardless of others. But that's not the case - we care about others and unless we have the traditional sadistic urges, we do not naturally choose the "unjust side". We can debate injustice being done in the name of safety and fear - but that doesn't imply that injustice was right, it implies that the enemy acts in manipulation to force ones hand, which then starts getting into a free-will delima.

Addressed in one of my favorite video-games, Darksiders, this implies a higher power dictating it all and judging what's actually just and unjust via a standard of justice. Just like the counsel in Darksiders sending the horseman to fight against both angels and demons in an effort to balance out justice. 



## 3. What is Christianity’s solution to the problem of evil and a good God, ¶s 10 and 11?

We are close to Dualism but not in a natural sense. Free-will allows perfect purity to accept corruption. That's what happened with Satan, he wanted to be like God, to be able to have that control. A great darkness that corrupted itself and now "rules the earth" turning it into a battleground and God allowing us to CHOOSE what to believe. God gives us the ingredients to make the world a better place, He gives us the solutions and the lifestyle for true happiness in the world but GIVES US THE CHOICE to abandon it. This is so beautiful of a concept that I want to write a book about it. 


## 4. In what ways have you experienced this world as a place of spiritual warfare

I watched a woman leave a car, take cash from the driver, and then enter the next car. This was a prostitute in Jamaica.
I watched children - completely naked - playing soccer in the streets of Jamaica because they had no money.
I drank and entire bottle of Buffalo Trace and gave into all my sinful urges when my wife left me and I felt so alone and empty. It wasnt until I re-embrased God that I found peace.
I've looked down the barrel of a .44 magnum when I was 18.
I looked down the barrel of a .45-70 a year ago.
I'm still here.
I've seen the mount of olives overtaken by graves of Catholic and Orthodox Jewish religions officials. Taking away from the legendary beauty of the mountain, and - in modern times - taking away from the impoverished people to construct more expensive tombs.
I saw as the Muslims took over the grounds directly in front of the East Gate choosing that as their holy grave location to spit in the face of Catholics and Orthodox Jews.
I walked through the Old City of Jerusalem which is smaller than 1 square mile yet contains 30,000+ jews, christians, muslims, atheists, catholics.
I saw a mosque in the exact location of the traditional "holy of holies" in Jerusalem and the muslims not allowing jews access to their historic holy place.
I've seen Bill Nye go viral by openly fighting christianity.
