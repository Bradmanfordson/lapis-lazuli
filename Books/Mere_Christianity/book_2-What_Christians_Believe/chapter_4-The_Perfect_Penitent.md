## 1. Christians believe that Christ was God in human form (the Incarnation) and that by his death he makes us right with God (the Atonement). How does Lewis explain the way that these two doctrines help us, ¶ 4? 

Multiple perspectives on a topic helps us understand the topic more deeply. If there is a viewpoint that hinders our understanding, we have another perspective to acknowledge that can help us understand.


## 2. What is at the heart of all the theories about how Christianity works, ¶ 5? 

Christ died and rose again, taking on death on our behalf and forgiving our sins. Sins He had no reason to take upon Himself, but He did anyway, for us. The truest form of love. 


## 3. What is the basic problem of human repentance, ¶ 7? 

The more a person needs repentance the harder it is for them to repent. Inversely, the less a person needs repentance the easier it is to do.

Addictions to pornography is harder to repent and quit when one is addicted. It's easy for me to say "i repent of drug use" because I've never done drugs. I need a hero (Skillet and  Bonnie Tyler) when it comes to addictions I struggle with.


## 4. How is Jesus Christ the solution to our human dilemma, ¶ 9?

Christ came and forgave me of my sins before I even commit them. He offered the ultimate sacrifice for me. I deserve Hell, but I won't meet it because I have a savior who holds my hand as i stumble, and like a loving father, picks me up and keeps me from giving up. Teaching me, humbly, with patience. 

I refuse to regret saying this, I cannot wait to be a father. To get to understand God on a deeper level as well as give my all to a little one and watch them conquer the world. I'm so excited. It'll be hard but I'm okay with this.
