## 1. Why does Lewis think it noteworthy to pay attention to the underlying dynamics of quarreling, ¶s 1 and 2? 
1. it's typically pretty pety/silly
2. Brains and neurological pathways are refined through experiences, no one has the same experience
3. Love the football analogy. Life is a big game of calvin ball
## 2. Why is there good reason to believe that the idea of a universal law of human nature is a solid truth, ¶s 7 and 8?
1. Biological evidence has us all unique yet we are all alike except for a few exceptions, we are all born nearly identical. This could imply a base framework for rational thinking and how our chemical makeup effects us.
2. Spiritual evidence also agree with the biological motives. even satanic customs believe in treating each other with respect and decently (unless they wrong you)
3. This is difficult for me. solid truths can be backed by logical proofs and this is such a complex problem, i don't believe it can be actually proved.
## 3. Lewis’s summary point is that while everyone believes in Right and Wrong, none of us is consistent in living that way, ¶ 11. How do you respond when someone points out your inconsistent behavior?
1. What i use to do: i get offended and fight or freeze
2. What i'm trying hard to do now: initially get upset but i'm working on recognizing when this occurs and try to step away and evaluate if they're right, determine what i believe, apologize if necessary, and work at fixing the problem. If it's a them thing, then i give myself distance from them.
