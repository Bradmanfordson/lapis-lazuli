## 1. Lewis has made a case for a reasonable and intelligent religious worldview in a culture which dismissed Christianity as passé and outdated. In what three ways does Lewis seek to counter common objections of his readers to Christianity, ¶s 2, 3 and 4? 
1. Repentance/Going back to right the wrongs we've made is the quickest path to the "right" path
2. Good vs God
3. the comfort of a salvation
## 2. Why is it that the God behind the Moral Law is both attractive and terrifying, ¶ 3? 
He defines a way of living a holy, righteous, good life
he helps guide us
but we sill sin all the time and in a natural sense, an all good God cannot condone anything not good, and we are not always good. meaning we regularly choose to be less godly and even miss the mark at being truly human
## 3. How is it that, according to the Moral Law, we can both desire God and discover that we have made ourselves his enemies, ¶ 3? 
He is our great comforter. He makes sense. A world that sees and strives for God is a great world. But this world is flawed because we have free will (attractive) and choose to not practice His will (unattractive)
## 4. Christianity makes no sense apart from a sense of the Moral Law and one’s personal inability to keep it, ¶ 4. How much sense does Christianity make to you?
There are more questions than answers. But I believe, base on observation and data, that this only points MORE towards divinity.
I mean.... just look at quantum mechanics.
