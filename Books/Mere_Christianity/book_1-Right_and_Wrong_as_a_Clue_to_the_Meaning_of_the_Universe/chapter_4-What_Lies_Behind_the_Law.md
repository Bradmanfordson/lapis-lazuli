## 1. There are two fundamental views of the universe, the materialist and the religious. How are these two views different from one another, ¶ 2? 
This is fairly straight forward in the book. But it maps closely to the modern delima of creationism vs big-bang. One is a complete happenstance and has no meaning or purpose
the other i literally the opposite
## 2. Why can’t science help us decide which view, materialist or religious, we should choose ¶ 2? 
Natural science sees both. We do observe purpose and order in our universe and lives as well as stars at night which are millions of light-years away. The observable facts is that we are created with a purpose by a creator. How he did it is left a mystery and doesn't NEED to be solved.
## 3. If we can’t find out about the Law of Human Nature from science, how can we investigate whether it actually exists or not, ¶s 3 and 4? 
We can observe massive amounts of data about how humans act throughout the world and the worlds history. As well as, the same data but for every other living creature on earth. We clearly see "survival of the fittest" in nature but humanity "irrationally" protects the weak. It is observed in nature that we have a special, higher purpose, calling, responsibility, and duty.
## 4. When you look inside yourself, what hunger and desires do you have, that point to something beyond?
- i want to learn more
- i want to be a good husband and a good father, this implies i wish to manifest servant leadership towards my wife and kids, meaning i shall not be selfish, as i once was, i shall protect them and cherish them will all my life
- I want to be a good employee - servant leadership and showing love and compassion to my fellow coworkers
- I want to continue to donate to causes i believe in
- I want to help those in need
