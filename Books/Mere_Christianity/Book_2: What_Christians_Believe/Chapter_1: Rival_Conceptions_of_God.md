## 1. The first major question everyone must confront is whether to believe in God or not. How do you respond, reading that Christians have a more “liberal view” than atheists about the existence of God, ¶ 1?

As with many things, we humans tend to try and find the easiest solution. Nearly always (as addressed later in this chapter) the "easiest" solution is often the one that logically makes no sense the deeper it's evaluated. Much of philosophy and theology is evaluated with the same emphasis as a limit in calculus. We tend to think "oooh this is the main point, and it just get smaller and smaller from there". But as observed,  time and time again, we see that philosophy and theology gets bigger and bigger the deeper we look.

With regards to a binary system we can observe the simplicity and dismissive nature of true atheism. Every human either believes in a Higher Power or they do not. The minority being true atheism. With the VAST majority believing in a higher power,, the true atheistic point of view looks to dismiss everything that points in anyway to a higher power. The irony is that they have to defend their stance infinitely more because they cannot just accept that there is no God, they have to work harder to disprove His existence. 

Christianity, as part of the majority, gets to objectively look upon other religions and see where they truly see God and see where the enemy has manipulated them with just enough of a blinder to keep them from seeing the glory of the one True God.
## 2. The second question everyone must face is to decide what kind of God to believe in, ¶ 3. Some, including Pantheists, believe that God is beyond good and evil. What is the fundamental problem of Pantheism, ¶ 4?

As Lewis stated, a great artist can put their heart and soul into their work, but burning the painting does not burn the artist. God has created the world from Himself. With the concept of free will He allows his creation to harm itself, but not inherently harm him. We have a nuclear arsenal strong enough to destroy the world several times over. Does that mean we can destroy God?

God being the universe implies that God can be corrupted by us, because we corrupt our universe. (well the enemy)
## 3. Others (Jews, Muslims and Christians) believe that God is good and judges evil. What’s the problem created by this point of view, ¶ 5?

I don't know if I'm understanding this question as it's intended. God is good and judges evil. We do not necessarily see the entire picture thus not understanding the distinction between the good and evil. 

Is the quetioner wanting me to bring up the point of "how do you understand injustice without a concept of justice?"
## 4. What problem must be confronted if you reject the God of right and wrong because there is cruelty and injustice in the world, ¶ 6?

Acknowledging injustice implies the absence of justice, thus implying the existence of justice. In the animal kingdom (generally), there is no classical justice/injustice system. It's largely a survival-of-the-fittest environment. Cocoa does not confront Hunny when Hunny takes her bone. They may fight, but the stronger will win and the weaker will retreat. After the bone is eaten by the victor, they're still friends.

What i'm trying to say here is that domestication of animals has taught animals to behave in various ways to achieve what they want. With dogs, they fight and steal, with humans they learn quickly that being sweet and lovey returns higher rewards. Some animals may adopt a love-like emotion regarding people or other animals, but largely there is no concept of justice and injustice. 

Humans are different. We do NOT operate on the survival of the fittest ideal. Largely, we operate on an understanding that the other humans have their own thoughts, feelings, emotions, beliefs, etc. We understand this connection with others because we were shown what that connection looks like through God. Through the breath of life and the Holy Spirit living in us we see others and acknowledge their hurts far further than any other creature in the animal kingdom. We are built for love because it is Love that built us.
