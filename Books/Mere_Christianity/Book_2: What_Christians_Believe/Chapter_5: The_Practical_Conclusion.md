## 1. Why would Lewis draw a parallel between sex and faith ¶ 2? 

Sex can be the most vulnerable, intimate, loving thing a human can do with another human. It can also be exploited to be the darkest, most hurtful, evil act a human can do to another human.

We are most "natural" and "ourselves" when we are clothed. We put on nakedness to embrace our loved one. Taking off everything, risking everything in an effort to show them how much we love them. 

Much like faith. One must put on "spiritual nakedness", something that appears natural but is quite embarrassing and intimate. We risk it all to get closer to our God, others can exploit us and hurt us. But when we act in true Faith and Love, it is the most pure we can be.

## 2. What do baptism, belief and Communion have to do with passing on the new life of Christ, ¶s 4 and 5? 

I'm struggling with this - I don't think I'm understanding what Lewis is getting at nor what the question is getting at.

I feel like the actions we take in reference to religions practices just help solidify that which has been taught to us. The physical observation of Him who we have a "secret, and intimate" relation with. Declaring "yup! This is my faith!" speaks volumes.

## 3. What do Christians mean when they say they are “in Christ”, ¶ 7, and why is that important?

We are trying to be like Christ, the perfect human, the standard to live up to. Without a standard to view and live up to we can only imagine what we're supposed to do. I can write excellent code but without the knowledge of proofs and operating system theories I will never write truly great code. Knowing about parallelism and optimization algorithms, i can take what I previously thought was great code and make it truly EXCELLENT.

Understanding and having a tangible example to live up to lets us know what our potential is and gives us something to always live up to and look up to.

## 4. After reading this chapter, what would you say to those who object to becoming a Christian because there are people in the world who have never heard of Jesus Christ?

Just because others haven't heard the truth, doesn't mean that you can ignore it. You have heard it, you have seen the proof, you are responsible for yourself. Just because others haven't heard the word does not mean that YOU are off the hook. Once they hear the word, they won't be "off the hook" either.
