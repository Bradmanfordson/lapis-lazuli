## 1. The existence of the devil doesn’t completely address the fundamental issue—how can a good, all-powerful God tolerate the existence of evil in his creation? How might the existence of free will be a good place to start in answering this question, ¶s 2, 3 and 4?

Free will is the only place to start with this question. Without free will, there is literally no purpose to this life. There is no purpose at all to this universe. Free will doesn't exists in our automation because it serves a direct purpose, to accomplish some task and die. If we have no free will then we are nothing except a program to accomplish a task and die. What would be the purpose of giving our programs sentience? Would it not be an extreme cruelty to give something sentience and not a purpose. What a sad, unimportant, waste of a life.

Marriage is hard, if it wasn't then what would be the point of it? There is no such thing as a fairy-tale ending. In fact, the difficulty is what makes it kinda fun, gives it purpose. What is a friendship without a little bit of conviction? Fare-weather friendships are written about in poems and epics throughout history as being worse than worthless. Deep friendships, like David and Jonathan, Gilgamesh and Enkidu, are some of the most beautiful tales in history. In fact, they are so powerful, it makes me wonder if that's what God and Satan had before the fall - not important, just a thought. 

I'm going all over the place here.
## 2. However, even the existence of free will raises questions about God. How can a good God make creatures that are capable of doing wrong, ¶ 5? 

This is perhaps the most difficult question ever pondered by humanity. I like Lewis' take on this. The idea that a perfect being can only be made more perfect with the ability to not be perfect. Perfection is nothing without it's inverse. This feels a little  "Yin and Yang" but not saying there is good in evil and evil in good. Controversy tends to breed deep thought and true meaning.

## 3. How did the Dark Power and our first ancestors go wrong, ¶ 6?

Jealousy and treachery. 

## 4. What three preliminary steps did God take to begin the rescue, ¶ 9?

He gave us conscience.
He send us prophets (good dreams) and visions of what is to come.
He conducted a case study with some of the most hard-headed folks earth has ever seen.

## 5. How is Christ the “shocking” solution, ¶ 10?

It makes no sense! It's EXTREME. It defies all logic and reasoning. And even 2,000 years later there is so much evidence for His existence and resurrection and yet still so many unanswered questions. It is truly a living breathing religion. Nothing the earth has ever seen can compare or do as much for humanity.

## 6. After reading this paragraph containing Lewis’s famous “Lunatic, Liar or Lord” trilemma, ¶ 13, how would you answer the person who says that Christ was merely a good teacher?

Evidence that Demands a Verdict breaks this down beautifully:

``` python
if Jesus_Claims == True:
	Jesus = Lord()
else:
	if Jesus_Knew_He_Was_False:
		Jesus = Liar() and Hypocrite() and Demon()
		Jesus.deliberate_misrepresentation()
		Jesus = Fool()  # because he died for a lie
	else:
		Jesus = Deluded() or Lunatic()
		
```

Heh.... 

Also if he was "just a good teacher" then how does one choose to not accept the teachings of Him being God. If you're following a great teacher and only some of what they teach is true, then they are not a good teacher at all. Especially if their claims are explicit and direct.
