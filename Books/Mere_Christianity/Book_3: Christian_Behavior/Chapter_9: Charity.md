## 1. Going against the flow of our cultural concept of love, Lewis writes that love is not a feeling but an action ¶ 2. What do you think of this? 

Uh yeah, 100%. Feelings of infatuation come and go, it has been proven time and time again that it is not sustainable nor accurate to base "love" off of feelings. Liking someone and being attracted to them is important in relationships, there is nothing wrong with it, but basing your love solely on that will not work. 

Love is making them a meal, showing up when they need, helping take their burdens, listening and acting on what their needs are. Sustainable love is simplified through love languages studies and application. Fun fact about the love languages - NONE OF THEM ARE ABOUT LOOKS!!! They're all work, lots of work.

The goal is to grow old with someone, not to "stick with them while they're fit and handsome" and find the next best thing once they're not as handsome and not as fit.

## 2. What are the dangers of hating and the benefits of loving, ¶s 7 and 8? 

Pride - the great sin - is just a mask for hatred. Satan has used and refined pride ever since the first sin to make hatred not seem so "extreme" and to justify sin. Hating causes rifts and disconnects us from relationships, which can lead others away from the Kingdom. If one is claiming to be of the Kingdom, but hold pride over someone and hates them, that person is more likely to associate the Kingdom with that conduct and thus fall away. God gave us a job to spread the word, He didnt say "yo dawg, imma just distribute this and y'all can do whatevs fam." He explicitly gave us a job to be of Him and not of the world. The meaning of life and why we are here is to bring others to Him, we can do that through whatever means we are passionate about. I can be the worlds greatest and achieved Doctor and STILL bring people to God. I can write cloud security controls with a team of atheists and have a lasting impact on them by living differently. I REALLY need to work on this, because right now i'm just an asshole.

## 3. How does Lewis’s definition of Christian love make our responsibility to love our neighbor both easier and more difficult?

It's easier to know that I dont have to like my neighbors.
It's difficult because I should still do things for them, even though i dont like them.
