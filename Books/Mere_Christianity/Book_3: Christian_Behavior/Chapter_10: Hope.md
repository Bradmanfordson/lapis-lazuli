## 1. Mere Christianity is filled with poignant phrases. One of the most famous is found in this chapter, “Aim at heaven and you will get earth thrown in. Aim at earth and you will get neither.” ¶ 1. Explain what he means. 

hmmm, this is difficult to express into words. Look at it from this perspective. If two people meet and decide to form a level of friendship, they WILL disappoint one another (most likely). Either one will choose the friendship is no longer worth their time, or they stay friends and the closer they get the more they have opportunities to do one wrong. There exists no human relationship that does not contain a level of hardship. That's the nature of the universe we exist in. Imperfection is more perfect than perfection.

As such, we will hurt one another. If we aim at only pleasing one another and living for each other only - we WILL hurt each other. If we aim at Heaven and a Godly life, we will still hurt one another, but the recovery is not as detrimental as "you hurt me, so i'm going to hurt you" - that's what's "fair" after all. Turning the other cheek makes no sense in a non-spirit lead life. We will expound on hurting one another until survival of the fittest takes affect. 

With a Godly lifestyle and worldview, we can cancel those spirals and achieve a better level of life. Thus aiming for heaven and getting a lil earth thrown in. Just aiming at earth leads to death and heartbreak/hardship.

## 2. In our culture, why is it difficult for us to have a Christian hope of heaven, ¶ 2? 

We're so focused on what we know. We cannot fathom information outside of our understanding of how the universe works. Having "faith" is frowned upon because today we have to have a logical reason for everything. Preachers get up and shout about how heaven is eternal worship music.... worship music like earth's is boring. I wouldn't want that for eternity. At least - i wouldn't want to spend an earthly human idea of infinite time on that. None of us have gone to Heaven, so we REALLY don't know. We can just imagine it'll be great. 

it's like the argument of "well i looked through a telescope and didn't see a big man with a beard". Yeah. great argument. take that Christians. 

Life is like a video game, if we lived in a video game we can be the characters and yearn for the beyond, but our physics and existing nature is IMPOSSIBLE to escape a video game and become a "real boy".

## 3. How is it that the desire for heaven gives a good reason to hope that heaven actually exists, ¶ 5? 

Throughout human existence there has been yearning for the beyond and death has always had connotations to an "afterlife". We imagine it as a physical place whereas we feel most in a "heavenly" or "blissful" state when our mindset is in a certain state.
We are not satisfied with this life, no matter what we do we never find full fulfillment. This could indicate to us that there IS more and better for us. If we cant get it in this life, then it has to be something after this life.
## 4. Are you more inclined to the Fool’s Way, ¶ 3, the Disillusioned Way, ¶ 4, or the Christian Way, ¶ 5, of thinking about heaven?

Natural inclinations is the Disillusioned way. I know this because of how i used to view heaven, i know that based on my "2 inches in front of my face" view of my life and work. If i stop to think about it, it'd agree i'm on the Christian way, but that's the thing, i need to evaluate and process, not just "naturally there"
