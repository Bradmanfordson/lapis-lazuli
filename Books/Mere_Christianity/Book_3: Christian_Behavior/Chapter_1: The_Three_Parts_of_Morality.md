## 1. Lewis writes that morality is concerned with three things: a) fair play, b) character, and c) eternal accountability, ¶s 3, 4 and 5. Which of the three is the most pressing concern for you? 
The second - harmonizing oneself. How can fair-play between individuals come about if the individuals aren't at harmony with themselves. How can humanity as a whole be at peace with each other if they are not at peace with themselves.
Take the plank out of your own eye before helping a brother with the splinter in his. 
Is it not selfish and actually dishonest to not become right with your self before trying to have "fair play" with others? You're putting on a face that you believe they want in an effort to win them over/instill peace instead of actually exploring your core values and standing up for what you believe in. You're lying to others when you do this and worse, you lie to yourself; you go about life in a dishonest facade instead of facing the reality of what you believe and what you stand for. This leads to the slow deterioration that Lewis describes - years of subtle annoyances that if prolonged a million years would lead to hell.  Being right with yourself and THEN surrounding yourself with like-minded individuals is the best way to live. 

## 2. Many people who think of morality just focus on fair play. What is the problem in ignoring the other two parts of morality, ¶s 7 and 8? 
See above.


## 3. How does the illustration of a naval fleet help explain how each aspect of morality is mutually independent ¶s 6, 7, 8 and 9?
It didn't actually help me, it just kind of confused me. But ships make up a fleet, individual parts, and du boat. Du Boat being the first piece. the second being the individual parts, and the fleet being the third.... i think. again, this kinda confused me.
