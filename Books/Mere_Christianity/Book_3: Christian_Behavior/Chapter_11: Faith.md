## 1. How is faith, like love, a “feeling to be learned”, ¶s 3, 4, 5 and 6? 

I had never considered this before reading this chapter, i always thought it was a "natural" thing. I've always struggled with faith. Being a man whose first instinct is to "disagree until proven otherwise" i find most things in faith difficult. I work on learning and it all makes sense but it's something i need to not forget, i have to train and form those thicc neurological pathways in my mind. It's hard for me to remember to pray, I've always needed reminders on my phone or something, i used to have a calendar with a checkbox for a daily prayer. Also i get desensitized to it. These are traits of forming habits and keeping the brain occupied. It's no question God made us the way he did and that this would probably be difficult for some, so it's a natural thing to need to learn.
## 2. Why is it foolish to think about faith as a bargain with God, ¶s 8 and 9?

He has more faith in us than we have in him. We are here because he put us here. He made us the way he made us. Struggles and doubts are PART of how we function, he made us this way to enable free-will and also to make this life mean something.

## 3. When you find your faith is weak, what can you do to strengthen it, ¶ 6? 

Specifically, i need to find something to study which peaks my interest. Learning about the Dead Sea Scrolls was amazing, GOING to Israel was amazing, reading some of the Apocrapha, etc. We fall away by becoming luke-warm. If we are truly hot, we will remain hot aslong as we continually add fire.
## 4. How has reading Mere Christianity so far strengthened your faith?

I realize that it's not "bad" to need phone reminders to pray. It's refreshing to see true analysis of Christianity and human nature and to see the connections.
