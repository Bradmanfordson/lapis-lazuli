## 1. Why might the Christian concept of forgiveness be even more unpopular than the Christian beliefs on sex and marriage, ¶s 1, 2, 3 and 4? 

Sex and marriage are things that people do regardless. So it's less about "do or do not" and more on the "how you do it" (pun intended)

Forgiveness is on the binary basis of "do or do not". It also has aspects of "how to do it" but that must be examined AFTER the decision to "do or do not". Sex and marriage are attractive from a secular perspective. Forgiveness is not.

## 2. How is the idea of loving one’s self the key to Lewis’s explanation of forgiveness, ¶s 5, 6 and 11? 

How can you look forgive someone when you don't love or value yourself. How can one harm you and require forgiveness if you don't love or care for yourself. If you truly hate yourself, then the only forgiveness you'd need to release to others is forgiving them from doing right to you. And that's just pathetic. You have to love yourself in order to forgive others and in order to allow yourself to be forgiven.
## 3. How is forgiveness central to the experience of eternal life, ¶s 7 and 10? 

Eternity is not 100 years, it's not 200 years, or a thousand, it's a thousand thousands to the power of a thousand, a thousand times, factorial-ed a thousand times and more. Even the smallest infraction left unforgiven will fester itself into an eternal life threat. How can you exist in paradise for eternity without being able to forgive even the smallest infraction?

## 4. Apply this chapter practically: Who are the top ten people you need to forgive? Write in a journal how you feel about forgiving them and then perhaps make plans to begin the process.

X, lucas, Todd, Paula, abdo, myself, i dont know - i havent let many people into my life enough to warrant me caring enough to forgive them. When someones infraction on my life that i genuinely do not care, then i dont know what to forgive
