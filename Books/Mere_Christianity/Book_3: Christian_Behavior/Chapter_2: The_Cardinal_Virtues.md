## 1. There are four cardinal or “pivotal” virtues: a) prudence, b) temperance, c) justice and d) fortitude, ¶ 2. In your own words, give a definition of each one. 
Prudence is common sense - the ability to see things for how they really are. To understand the core of the issues/task.
Temperance is when someone abstains from something because they feel it's right for themselves.
Justice is keeping true and honest. The act of dishonestly is unfair/just to those whom are on the side being lied to. 
Fortitude is courage to stand up for what you believe, what you fear but must overcome, what your are charged with as a man.

## 2. If one social grouping—club, association, lodge, etc.—was especially filled with many people who practiced the four cardinal virtues, in what ways might that be unique and attractive? 
They would be seen as wise, honest folk. They'd be basically human super heroes without the capes or super powers. They'd be the prime candidacy for true and fair politics. 
They could band together and - as iron sharpens iron - sharpen each other. If it was a club/association, those outside of them would be able to come to them with the problems of the humanity/the world and they'd be able to come together and give solid advice/solutions.
If it was an association then it would imply a membership type structure which could yield itself a mentorship program to train and sharpen others such that the association grows, thus bettering the world exponentially.

## 3. How does the illustration of a tennis player explain what it means to be virtuous, ¶ 6? 
Practice make perfect. One can be virtuous by just being around and having their actions and reactions yield all kinds of wild results, sometimes resulting in the right thing. Whereas, refinement, practice, training yields less chaotic results and more precise and meaningful actions/reactions.

## 4. Virtue is a quality of character that God is very concerned with. Why is virtue important for this life and the life to come, ¶s 8, 9 and 10?
Because it means we're refined, we're not slaves forced to fight. We are warriors trained and hardened to face the toughest of foes. We do not have a weak or easily tripped up enemy, we need to be hardened fighters, willing to give our lives for the right cause, and not just as a body shield, but as a true force to be reckoned with. Without being refined in these virtues, we are just random entropy, will a billion bullets, eventually a monkey will hit 3 bullseye in a row (while taking out the rest of the zoo in the process).
