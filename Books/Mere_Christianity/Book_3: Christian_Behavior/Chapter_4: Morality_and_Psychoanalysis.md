## 1. Christianity and psychology are both concerned with the inner person, yet each has a unique focus. According to Lewis, how are they different, ¶ 4? 

I haz the confusion, idk why i'm not grasping this whole chapter. So like.... morality is concerned with what you do and psychoanalysis is concerned with how you feel about it?

Christianity is concerned with the laws and proven behaviors that have been laid down to us through law (summed up to "love") right? but psychology is basically going back re-discovering these laws - which lead to true happiness - for the "first time". Is it that even tho you feel another way, you still make the moral choice with christianity, whereas psychology focuses in on making the "weird feelings" valid, thus eliminating natural morality?
## 2. How does the illustration of the two soldiers help explain the difference between morality and psychology, ¶ 5? 

It rationalizes the irrational thus enabling immoral choices "moral". 

## 3. Why is it unwise to judge the moral actions of others, ¶s 7 and 9? 

Because we don't know the context of the individual, we only know the context of ourselves. For me, the choice between Krispy Kreme and heroin is EASY - imma take Krispy Kreme all day - any day. I'm addicted to fatty foods and processed sugars and have had no interaction with heroin so it is nothing for me to choose the donut. There is nothing really "moral" about me choosing the donut. The more "moral" choice for myself is to deny BOTH. But a heroin addict/recovery person might have a really really hard time with this, they might choose the donut and, for them - and I believe the eyes of God - that's the moral choice, it's more moral for them to deny their addiction and desires in favor for something else than for me to indulge in my addiction and desires because on the surface it doesnt "appear as bad".
## 4. How will Lewis’s reflection on inner motivation make a difference in your relationships with others?

Patience is really the biggest key here. We need to embrace and practice patience often to help perfect this but we need to step back and ask ourselves why we believe the person did XYZ action. Instead of taking our personal context into the situation, we have to ask ourselves the following set of questions:
1. Do I even care?
2. If I do, do I disagree?
3. If I do, do I care about the relationship?
4. If I do, then I need to stop and communicate with them why they got to the conclusion they did, try to set my contextual biases aside and try and understand from their view.
5. Once that is complete and I understand - does it change my opinion?
6. If not, then I need to convey - respectfully - why I feel and believe the way I do and help them understand why I have my perspective.
With healthy relationships and a bucket of patience the above can all be done in a very respectful and meaningful manner.
