## 1. Lewis writes, “Pride leads to every other vice; it is the complete anti-God state of mind.” ¶ 2. Why does Lewis call pride the chief sin, ¶s 3 and 8? 

The pride he's referring to is the competitive pride, the "I'm better than you" pride. Without that pride we are free to see and celebrate others accomplishments, skills, and perspectives. With that pride, our interactions with people are not on the pure of heart level but instead we frame our happiness and worldview around being better than others. If others are better than us, we don't celebrate them, we disdain them and work on ways to beat them.

## 2. Not everything that goes by the name of pride qualifies as sin, ¶s 10 and 11. Why isn’t pride in being praised by others or taking pride in another person, sin? 

Lewis touched on this, it's not "pride" it's having great feelings of affection for someone by seeing them accomplish great things. Being acknowledged for good work is something we are allowed to be happy at. If we are happy because our work is being recognized as better than someone else's work, then that's not being happy in ones own work, it's being happy that someone else "lost".

Being happy that you did a good job is acknowledging praise and a form of appreciating and loving yourself. Having great feelings of affection for anothers achievements is loving them. There is nothing wrong with love. God is love. We can be like God when we love ourselves and others, it's kinda in the Bible.

The other form of pride is NOT love, therefore it is not of God. It could be considered the opposite actually, a form of hate.

## 3. True pride is not so easy to spot, ¶ 8. In what ways might you catch a glimpse of pride in those around you? What do you discover when you begin to look for pride in yourself?

It's easy to notice pride in those around you when you're prideful yourself. The unspoken competitive nature no longer becomes unspoken. It becomes aggressive and leads down bad roads. 

Without it being directed at me, I can see pride manifest in others in their wording and the actions they take when interacting with someone they are in that competition with. We also see this literally all the time in media. Media is satans sounding board. It doesn't just show us how our countries "leadership" is prideful, but also the extreme over connectivity of our culture is designed to ensnare us in the pride trap and exponentially accelerates it's intensity. 

I saw it vividly in myself yesterday and today - one of my "competitors" challenged me and shot me down left and right last week when I had concerns, my response was to over-analyze their stance and come back with holes in each one. It was WRONG on my part but I found a hole in our security controls not because it's my job, but so I could beat my competitor. On one hand, it was good I found the hole, but ultimately my mindset is "fuck you, i'm going to break shit so i can prove you wrong." That is the opposite of love and since God is love, the opposite of God. I saw it today when I "shadow-work" created a script to investigate some metrics. A different competitor embarrassed and talked down to me in a meeting, as such I shadow-worked a metric so i could prove them wrong. When I did prove them wrong with data I 100% messaged them about it. I wasn't aggressive in my messaging, i just showed them the details. But the REASON was the silent "told you so" that I have been holding against them.
