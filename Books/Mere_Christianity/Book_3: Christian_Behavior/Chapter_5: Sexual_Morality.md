## 1. Lewis provides three reasons why he believes that the sexual appetite, not the Christian teaching on sex, is out of order. What are they: ¶s 3, 4 and 6? 

"biological need" - we need to eat, we also have sexual needs. We have physical and mental mechanisms in our body and mind to largely limit our eating. We have much less controls with sexual needs.

"starvation" - given our sexual appetite doesn't necessarily fill up like a stomach, we don't necessarily have an end. We keep expounding and getting to the point we obsess, in fact we worship it. We NEED more and more to be filled up

"perversion" - Like a stomach, the more you eat, the more your stomach grows, thus requiring more to get full. And typically, the larger the stomach, the larger the tolerance and desire for "unhealthy food"....... it expounds on itself

## 2. While the sexual appetite is out of order, what hope is there for those who want to change, ¶ 9? 

God knows.
He kinda made sexuality.... And he's a forgiving God. We get to get up every day and try our best, and when we fail, we repent and get back up. There is no score board - tho the enemy would like us to believe there is. Therefore, we just keep trying, genuinely trying. God knows our hearts.

Depending on the "intensity", most out of order sexual appetite is filled on a largely individual basis. Such as a pornography magazine, or a smut book, or a x rated movie. It's an individual harming themselves by indulging in this. 

This is not the case for all out of order sexual appetites, some degenerates take it out on others and this is NOT OKAY.
## 3. What challenges and difficulties must be faced for those who are seeking a cure to a dysfunctional sexual appetite, ¶s 10, 11 and 13? 

The enemy has had THOUSANDS of years as well as biology to use against us. He tricks us to believe that it's healthy because, I mean... we all watched animal planet at some point.... Everything does it. 

The enemy leads us to believe it's impossible to overcome.

Increasingly so, western civilization is flooded with copious amounts of porno-graphical content. One of the highest rated tv series of all time is known for pushing the limits on how graphic they can film sex scenes and still have the majority of people watch it. Movies are increasing in their "apparent need" to show more and more nudity. Some mainstream videogames allow the player to customize the characters genitalia. Our music is all about bitchs and hoes. Our advertisements are more and more provocative. It's nearly impossible to be raised in the united states - NOT BE AMISH - and NOT see porno-graphical content "by accident" by the time you're 8 years old.

## 4. What difference has this chapter made in the way that you think about Christianity and sex?

It hasn't really. I mean the "looking at pictures of food" was an interesting way of realizing how the brain works on pornography. But it hasn't really made me think of anything differently. It was a good reminder on how the brain works though.
Sexuality is a sacred union between husband and wife. It's a tool for uniting them in a way no others can be united. Sharing intimate union with one another.
