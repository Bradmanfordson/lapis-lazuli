## 1. In Book Three of Mere Christianity Lewis has written about Christian virtue and values. Why is it important that we make every possible effort to live a moral life, ¶ 7? 

In human nature, it makes sense to follow Christian guidelines and live morally to have the safest and best possible life we can. We can aim for Heaven and we always have a reason to keep on fighting.
## 2. When making an effort to live a moral life, why should a Christian “leave it to God”, ¶s 5 and 6? 

Worrying just expounds worry - GIVING problems and hardships to God lets us trust that He has something better in mind or different at least. God is the inventor of physics that contradict itself.... think He has a better handle on things than we do...
## 3. How does faith affect the way in which we live by Christian virtue and values, ¶ 7? 

We aim to live a life of Godliness - not just being "good" but what God sees as good and with faith we can give to God and/or allow things to not worry us or persist as a worry. Things happen we cannot control, allowing God the room to move sounds like a contradiction of free will, but it's freely allowing one to be guided to clear waters.

## 4. In your reading of Mere Christianity so far, what have you learned about the Christian faith that you did not know before?

Pride. Most of everything else i knew to a degree or another. This has deepened those thoughts and given me more "heart" to pursue a more structured Christian lifestyle. It has definitely helped putting things into logical arguments and proving that the lifestyle of Christianity is the most beneficial for humanity by starting the proof at humanity and not Christianity. Makes it more real.
