## 1. Lewis observes that the Christian idea of marriage is extremely unpopular, ¶ 1. Do you agree? 

Do I believe it's unpopular? I mean, given unpopular means "lack of general approval", then yes, I'd say it's unpopular.
The Christian marriage focuses on selflessly serving another, singular, human being for the rest of your life. Slavery with benefits. I mean not really "slavery" but the purpose is to put your spouse above yourself and to hold them in the highest regard. Encourage and enable them to be the best person they can be, without expecting anything in return. 
To forgive someone countless times for constantly wronging you.
To go to bed with only 1 person for the rest of your life. In modern western culture this is HIGHLY unpopular, I mean the average number of sexual partners before marriage is something like 7. 
Why would this be popular in the general sense, this - at face value - appears to be pretty limiting in the "fun" factor.

Now do i personally find the Christian idea of marriage attractive? Yes.
Absolutely.
Marriage is the biggest investment anyone can make. If we look at it from a purely "investment" mindset type of lens then it's absolutely amazing. You put your stock into 1 person, that person then grows based on how YOU treat them and act with them. The ball is in your court and you get to decide if the investment grows exponentially or if it dies. There is no "oooh but it was XYZ's problem, blame Covid19, or whatever politician" NO. It's you and them against the world. Partners in life, emphasis on "PARTNERS". They fall, you pick them up, you fall, they pick you up.
If we rid ourselves of the reality of human nature and look strictly at what an ideal marriage would be. You invest in them, they invest in you. You grow them, which, in turn, grows you. You get immediate dividends as well as shooting to the moon.

On a safety perspective, assuming you are AS invested in the relationship, thus eliminating the need for double talk in this paragraph. We all have our insecurities. As alluded to earlier, we all fall. The safety net of someone there to catch us when we fall, not someone who is here for a thrill but someone who is deeply invested and cares about your well-being from a physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual perspective. To be able to put your trust in someone who you know for a fact will not run out on you, will not take the easy road because it's fun. Someone who truly cares about YOU and the relationship. Who could ask for more safety. Someone who is there to hold you as you cry, to wrap their arms around you at night when you have a bad dream or feel alone. Someone who can see you're hurting just by looking you in the eyes when you're putting on your best poker face. The intimate relationship and connection with that person. That's so beautiful. Who wouldn't crave that?

From a sexual perspective. It has been proven time and time again that "sexual compatibility" is a myth. It's something people came up with so they can justify having relations with someone. Sexuality is something learned between partners. It's awkward and kind of weird, but - and it's been proven - it gets better with time and experience WITH THE SAME PERSON. Much like learning to communicate with someone - it's not necessarily just "piece of cake" at first. It takes practice the more practiced the better it gets. So now, with that fact, investing in your one person also includes this. You "invest more" they "invest more" and eventually this part of your marriage portfolio ALSO GROWS. Everything grows!

Now on to the post-sexual perspective. One of the most important things a human can do is to have and raise children. Now imagine for a minute the thought of raising your child with someone who doesn't care. Who isn't invested. who can just drop out because they're bored or want something else. That's immensely terrifying!!! Having that safety net of "you're my one and only, my chosen, my beloved" adds to that aspect as well. You and yours get to team up and be a strong union when doing the most difficult, stressful, and POTENTIALLY rewarding acts humans can do.

There is so much goodness that comes from the christian ideal of marriage that is overlooked because people want to boink.... to the general western civilization, yeah, it's unpopular... that's proven by divorce levels and average number of sexual partners. But from a "sit down and think dammit" perspective, it's the most beautiful thing God gave us. A union so close to what God wants with us, what Jesus has with the Church... There's nothing more powerful than two people who have each other back NO MATTER WHAT. That's why marriage is such an important choice, it's not something to be taken lightly, it's a difficult choice and one that must be taken with WAY WAY more thought than the thought that goes into the following query: "You HAVE to put all of your investments, cash, and 10% of your future cash into a SINGLE COMPANY STOCK and you can't take it out until you're 65, which one do you choose?"

## 2. Why does Christianity teach that marriage is for life, ¶s 2 and 3? 

I love the violin and bow analogy here. That's really quite well worded.

As stated above, the safety and importance in the investment decision. As with all instrument players, the amount of practice necessary to "git gud" is incredibly intimidating, annoying, frustrating, and immense. It often takes years for someone to even get decent at any instrument. As is marriage. It's difficult, it's awkward, it takes time and practice. But the further it goes the easier and more fluid it gets, to the point of being extraordinarily beautiful.

It just takes time, fortitude, courage, and practice.

There is some obvious safety related topics that are brought up often, and Lewis addresses these topics, topics like: the woman risking her career for the marriage, sacrificing for the children, etc. These are extremely good points, the safety aspect of 1-1 for life alleviates unnecessary stress on top of already immense levels of stress.

## 3. What do you think of Lewis’s suggestion that there should be two kinds of marriage, ¶s 4, 5 and 14? 

With the world as it is, not everyone is a Christian and not all Christians can actually think past "mom and dads religion". As such, I think there are needs for a marriage definition to be distinct in terms of man made law and in terms of God made laws. God made obviously being the Christians ways... which are right and best for everyone. But if folks feel the need to not think past their eyebrows (which most don't) then there needs to be a "man-made" construct to protect individuals and children when two people decide to make the marriage investment and then call early. Children deserve more. The one abandoned deserves more. 

## 4. What is the problem of basing a marriage on the popular ideal of “being in love”, ¶s 9, 10, 11 and 12? 

Infatuation lasts, on average, 12-18 months. "Being in love" is just infatuation with a less "lawyer-y" tone. Fact are facts - it doesn't last. It feels good being infatuated, and it's not a shame to be infatuated, but to not allow yourself to get past the googly-eyes and evaluate the situation and your LONG-TERM investment for more than 12-18 months.... then that's a problem. You're not getting married for 12-18 months, you're getting married for 60-80 years. Why would you rush yourself into a LIFE commitment because of butterflied in your stomach?
## 5. After reading this chapter, what advice would you give to a young couple about to get married?

How old are you? Look at pictures and give me a single (or multiple, idgaf) story WITH a picture from every single year of your life. Now, realize how LONG you've been alive. Let's say you're 25 years old. Imagine if there person you are currently wanting to marry was with you from day 1 to now. They're in every story, in every picture, in every memory.

Now, realize that you have 2-3 more "your lifetimes" that you're going to be with them. What gets on your nerves? are you ready to live 2-3 more lifetimes with that annoyance? they're not going to change. It's up to you. 

How do they handle stress? How do they treat animals? This is a good indicator of how they'll treat YOUR children. Do you want someone who beats their dog to raise - and likely beat - YOUR child? Do you want someone who punches holes in the wall and throws things across the house while yelling and screaming to react that way when the child breaks a windows playing baseball?

Are you just horny? Be real with yourself. 

Do they actually respect you? That teasing they do, does it hurt your feelings, even a little? If all they do is poke fun and never flatter you or listen to you or care about anything you care about, then they do not respect you. Don't marry someone who doesn't respect you.

Can you trust them. I thought I could, I was wrong.
