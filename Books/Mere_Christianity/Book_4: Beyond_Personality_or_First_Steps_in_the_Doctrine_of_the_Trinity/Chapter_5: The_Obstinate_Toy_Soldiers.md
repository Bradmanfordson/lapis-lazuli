## 1. How does the analogy of the toy tin soldier explain God’s agenda for the human race, ¶s 3 and 4? 

It shows how we like what we know. The tin soldier liked tin (or might have) and the change to something "better" is all relative. Gods has the perfect view, but we have a view as well. As did the toy soldier. Change is scary and embracing a new life style and manner of existence is hard.
## 2. Jesus Christ is not only God, but the true human—that which God intends for us all, ¶ 5. According to Lewis, what difference will that make for you and me, ¶ 8? 

We don't have to do the hardest work, the work we can never attain, which is earning salvation. By having Jesus come do that for us, we have a human who earned it and come in us to help us through life.
## 3. In what ways do you resist God’s transformation from a tin soldier to a true human? In what ways do you welcome it? 

I over think constantly and don't "give it to God" i have an extremely difficult time doing this because I feel like "giving it to God" is giving up and being lazy. I have to do it, I have to do it all, God will help me in ways I see and don't see, but I still have to do it.

I welcome the fact that I'm a flawed human being. I hurt, I sin, I break promises, I betray others, I hurt others and am hurt by others. But I can accept that God loves me just the way I am.
Thinking about those whom I am friends with who do not believe in God but I feel, as a human, that if God were to damn them, I "in my cute little human imagination" think I would say "but he/she is a good person, they have the right heart, just not the right Book/worldview" and the beautiful thing is, that's Jesus. Because without him, we all fall short. Not only fall but we don't even deserve to be in Gods presence in the first place. But through Jesus we have forgiveness and a true human look at the heart on top of the Godly look at the heart.
This gives me hope.
