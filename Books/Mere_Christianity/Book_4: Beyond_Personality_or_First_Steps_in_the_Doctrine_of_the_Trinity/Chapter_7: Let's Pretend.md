## 1. Why is choosing to act like Christ essential to becoming like Christ, ¶s 2, 3 and 4? 

We must practice, to practice being like someone else or to practice a different mindset, we must first rewrite ourselves. At first it feels awkward because we're "pretending", but this is necessary.
## 2. How can we recognize the spiritual help of Christ in shaping our character, ¶s 7 and 8? 

We need to stop and practice mindfulness. Christ does not ONLY work in major miracles. If we were cast into a burning furnace and lived, we could see Christs help abundantly. But this isn't really a "daily" thing. Christ works through all means and medians. Sometimes my dog resting it's head on my lap when I'm depressed is Christ showing me some comfort.
## 3. What is our role and what is God’s role in transforming our character, ¶s 12 and 13? 

Our first step is to wake up and realize ourselves. Realize how we're falling short and start implementing corrective measures.
God pretends for us, lol. He pretends we're Christ like and beautifully made, He truly believes it, therefore, we ARE Christ like and beautifully made. It's back to our side to REALIZE that we are beautifully and wonderfully made, we are sons and daughters of God.

## 4. Based on the insights from this chapter, how might you be able to discern the help of Jesus Christ in your life this week?
