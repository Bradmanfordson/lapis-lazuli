## 1. How does the analogy of evolution help us understand the transformation that God is bringing about through faith in Jesus Christ, ¶ 2, 3 and 4? 

Evolution is about progressive change, not a sudden "KERBLAMO - A VELOCIRAPTOR!!! AND NOW A MONKEY - ALAKAZAM - A FIIIIIIIIISH!!!!!!!!!"
It's slow, it's gradual. But also, looking at the theory of evolution, it's gradual change into a different species altogether.
## 2. How is the next step in human evolution different than previous ones, ¶s 5, 6 and 7? 

Assuming evolution exists as some scientists believe it to, then we did not gradually change here and there. We transformed into a higher being, a being without protective shells. Our new defense system is in a manner that couldn't have been comprehended by the previous iteration. So if we try to imagine the next step in human evolution, we need to stop thinking about how many hands we'll have and start trying to think of what we couldn't even see coming. Fun fact - God gave us the answer. It's spiritual being. We are to be transformed and renewed into spiritual beings, not ghosts, but men and women whom are reliant on God and Christ. It's much much MUCH more deep than it outwardly appears.
## 3. What illusions of “self ” must you escape if you are to become a true person, ¶s 13, 14 and 15? 

To give up ones self. Our worldly possessions, our pursuit of things n stuff. We must stop looking so intently at this specific thing or that, we need to trust. God kinda has a plan!
## 4. What is your role in your own evolution, ¶ 9?

To acknowledge and allow it in my life. To allow God to do His thing, to understand I'm learning to walk and ride the bike. He isn't so upset with me falling down, though it hurts me and makes me disappointed, He is observing and eagerly awaiting my getting back up. He is proud, not disappointed. This mindset, worldview, spirit, etc. is what's next. To understand I'm His, and He is mine.
