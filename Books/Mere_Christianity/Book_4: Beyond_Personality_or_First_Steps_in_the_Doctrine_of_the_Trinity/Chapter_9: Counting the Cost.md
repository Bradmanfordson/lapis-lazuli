## 1. God’s expectation for us is moral perfection, ¶ 1. Why shouldn’t we be discouraged when we repeatedly fail, ¶ 6? 

Because God understands. We are thrust into a world controlled by sin. An existence overrun by demons and evils. God is our father, we can only learn to ride the bike perfectly through practice and experience. He understand we fall, but - like a father watching his child - isn't discouraged when He sees us fall, instead He sees us getting back on the bike and He is proud! 
## 2. What does Lewis mean, Christians are in for a rough time, ¶s 9 and 11? 

In order to achieve what God has in store, we must be torn down completely. We are imperfect beings and God's goal for us is to be perfect. Logically, it would suffice to say that imperfection disqualifies any chance at being perfect because perfect would imply always having been perfect.
## 3. If being a Christian is so hard, why would anyone want to become one, ¶s 3, 4 and 7? 

God is not here to mend little boo-boos, He is here to make perfect creatures. He created us for that purpose. We are intended to be perfect. God - master and creator of the universe, of logic, of physics, of mathematics, a God who creates colors and everything we could ever imagine AND MORE - created us for a purpose. Therefore, with Him, we can achieve this purpose. It's not impossible! He sees us, He sees us falling off the bike, but He is proud when we get back up because we're striving to be like Him. The focus is on the persistence, not the falls.
## 4. What reservations might you have toward the Christian faith? 

It's scary. Like the baby, I am comfortable in my little womb, it's warm, it feels safe, free food!!! Being told that I've been created by a God who isn't satisfied with me as I've been created makes me want to say that He cannot be perfect because His "perfect creation" isn't even up to His own standards. Feels like life was a big trap. But the key ingredient I've left out of that argument is free-will, the ultimate ingredient.
