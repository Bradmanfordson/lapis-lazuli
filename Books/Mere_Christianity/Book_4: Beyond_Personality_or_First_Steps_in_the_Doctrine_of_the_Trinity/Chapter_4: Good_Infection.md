## 1. What is the practical benefit that comes from understanding the eternal relationship between God the Father and God the Son, ¶ 5? 

I do not know what it's referring to given that paragraph. But my interpretation is we have a savior to relate to. God the Father is the... well father, He watches us grow and helps correct us when we stumble, but God the Son is a human, he's like our friend who sees us about to stumble and goes, "hey buddy, i don't think that's a good idea."
## 2. Lewis explains the Trinity in a practical way, like a dance, ¶ 8. What personal benefits come to us through each person of the Trinity, ¶ 7? 

It helps quantify and give reasoning that we can understand in all aspects of our life. The father observing, the son guiding and the spirit living through. All ways we are programmed for influence.

## 3. Which person of the Trinity are you more inclined to connect with, the Father, the Son or the Holy Spirit? 

The Son. The Holy Spirit I still have trouble really noticing. I know it's our connection to God and alladat but I still don't think about it when going to God. The Father I view as a strict fatherly figure. But the Son, He walked the earth and knows our pain and struggles. The fact that God can reject us but Jesus can swoop in and say "no, this one is mine!".... that human level of forgiveness. I can understand that better so i relate to it more.

## 4. Getting to know God is like catching a good infection, ¶s 8, 9, 10 and 11. What can you do to catch the divine infection? 

The longer you stand in the fire the more you're burned, the more you dunk yourself in water, the wetter you get. The more you accept God and live your life the more you become Godly. The "infection" gets more and more intense and builds off of itself.
