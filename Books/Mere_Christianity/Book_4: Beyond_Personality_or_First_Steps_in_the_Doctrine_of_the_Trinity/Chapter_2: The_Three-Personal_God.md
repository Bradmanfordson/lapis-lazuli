## 1. The Christian God is not impersonal, like the “Force” in Star Wars. Why is this good news, ¶ 3? 

The Force is so simple. We use our human understanding to craft religions. Therefore, the limit of what we can make is the limit of what we can imagine. And this is quite simple..... But God, the one true God, is not created by man. Christianity is so divine and deep that we will never be able to fully understand and comprehend what it means. It is beyond our possible reasoning. This is good news for a variety of reasons, namely that it gives itself credit for being true, where as other religions are easily deconstructed.
## 2. According to Lewis, theology is very practical, ¶ 4. What is the practical good of knowing that God is a tri-personal being, ¶s 8 and 9? 

Theology is practical! The science of religion, the reasoning behind it and understanding of it. I love it!!

Because God is not just a "dude up in the clouds with a big beard" but we can understand God in all aspects. From the fatherly figure whom guides and teaches with a grasp on a guiding rod, to the human dude Jesus who was 100% human and 100% God, we can relate to Christ, and then the "aura"/feeling of goodness and Godliness that is the Holy Spirit. And they're all the same. Like Ice, Water, and Steam!

## 3. How does personal character help or hinder us in the knowledge of God, ¶s 13 and 14? 

I really liked the analogy in this! The dirty mirror!!!

In order to better understand God, we have to be like God and keep ourselves pure so we can better see and understand him. If we wanted to peer deeply into space, we'd need a good telescope. If we don't keep that telescope clean, we won't be able to tell stars from specs of dust!  (or more accurately, cracks in the lense to alien bases on mars)

## 4. What do you personally discover about God when you look inside yourself ? 

I discover the creativity and reason. My gifts are to understand complexities in computing and I have seen VERY CLEAR correlations to creation, understanding, rational, etc. through the lense of my worldview and education. The logical reasoning and rational that God brings. The way I can view and understand God by viewing it through my education/skill-set help me to get closer to God and understand Him more. The more I study and pray and keep myself whole, the more clearly the lense of where God has put me and WHY God has put me here.
