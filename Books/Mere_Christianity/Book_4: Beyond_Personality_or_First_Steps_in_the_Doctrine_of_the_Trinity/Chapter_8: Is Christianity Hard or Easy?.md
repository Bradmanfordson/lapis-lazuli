## 1. What is the difference between the ordinary idea of morality and that of Christian morality, ¶s 2 and 3? 

Ordinary morality is understanding X is good, and Y is bad. Most often we desire Y, but morality is choosing to not pursue Y, despite our desires. As an example, we desire to hoard all of our money for ourselves. But it is morality that tells us we should give to the poor.

Christian morality is giving oneself to God and living as such. Our goal is to live like Christ. God doesn't care so much about our money, it's about being like Him. It's less focus on the actions, and more focused on the outcome.
## 2. How does Lewis use the images of a grass field and eggs to explain how Christianity is both hard and easy, ¶s 7 and 9? 

Maintaining a field is hard work and never-ending work. To create a field of different crop (or grass, or whatever) one must first uproot everything that exists there currently. Completely destroy it. Upon utter destruction and removal of the life, we are left with rich dirt. It is then, that the new crop is ready to be planted. But we must also maintain. Foreign objects come to choke out parts of the field, we must tend our new field and weed out the garbage.

The field is a choice, we can live with it as grass, wheat (well, some of us can), barley, etc. But an egg does not have much of a choice, it's life is dependent on hatching - on transformation. Without such, it will die.
## 3. How can all the various religious activities of the church get in the way of the one central point of Christianity, ¶ 10? 

The point is to bring others to Christ. If the church becomes a clique, then outsiders will actually be discouraged from joining. There are a lot of "ordinary morality" that is replaced with christian morality in the church, as such, the church just appears to be the new Life DLC of more rules to follow.
## 4. What do you find difficult about Christianity? What do you find easy? 

Difficulty, remembering. Being diligent and constantly striving to be like Christ. I get comfortable all to easy and forget.

Easy, understanding that I am a good man. God created me. He loves me as I am, if I wasn't supposed to be here, why would I even be here?! I am a good man, a loving man and I know God loves me.
