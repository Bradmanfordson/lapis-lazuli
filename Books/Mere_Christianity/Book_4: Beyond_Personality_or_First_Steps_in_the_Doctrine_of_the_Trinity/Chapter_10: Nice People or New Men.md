## 1. What’s the problem with expecting that Christians should be “nicer” than other people, ¶s 3, 4 and 5? 

Humans are humans. Setting expectations for a group of people gives us the opportunity to say, "See, they're not perfect and nice like their group!!" That's unrealistic and unfair.
## 2. How do the illustrations of toothpaste and factory management help explain how Christians do change in their moral development, ¶ 5? 

Everyone is different. Some of us have been blessed with an "easy life". Heavy air quotes. All lives have their own struggles, one mans struggle may not be another mans. A man who struggles severely with alcohol is not in a place to judge a man having a glass of wine with his dinner.
## 3. From a Christian perspective, what is the problem of being “nice”, ¶ 11, 13 and 15? 

Chris's favorite word!! Growth comes from pushing through difficulty. Being simply "nice" gets us into comfort and routine.
## 4. Many people dismiss Christianity by saying that the church is full of hypocrites. What would you say to them after reading this chapter? 

Yes, the church is full of hypocrites. But judging a beautiful pond in the forest simply because it has some mosquitoes buzzing about doesn't give a quality review of the pond, now does it?
