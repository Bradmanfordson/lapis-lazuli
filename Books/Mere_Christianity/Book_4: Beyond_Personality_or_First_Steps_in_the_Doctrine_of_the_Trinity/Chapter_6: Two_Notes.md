## 1. Why God “begot” one son—Jesus Christ—so that he might create many, is a great mystery; why bother thinking about it at all, ¶s 1 and 2? 

It's the whole point of Theology. To think and reason behind these kind of ideas. This is a non-salvation-altering thought-experiment we can use to explore and find out more about God. We will never get the answer but it'll continue to challenge great thinkers and we will discover more about God the more we explore and study Him and ponderances like this.
## 2. What benefits come from knowing both our spiritual unity with the rest of the human race and yet our personal distinctiveness, ¶ 3?

We can see and celebrate our differences because God made us to be different. But also understand that hurting ourselves hurts the whole "organism" it's detrimental to hurt others and ourselves. Our bodies are a temple and we are the church.
